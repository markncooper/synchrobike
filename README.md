Synchronized LED across bike lights

The goal of this project is to synchronize amazing LED animations and colors across countless wiresless LED nodes.

Range: I was able to successfully sync two nodes at a distance of 180m before running out of line of sight.
Current code 

## Current Status:
- [x] Sudo-randomly generated noise LED animation, color pallets, and animation direction synchronized with all nodes connected to the mesh network.
- [ ] Create Hardware and Software sections detailing how components are conected and how to upload sketch to the Wemos D1 Mini.
- [ ] Power section detailing power usage at different brightness and LED count.
- [ ] Include video/gif demo of synchrobike(s) in action.
- [ ] Animation(s) for when a new node is added to the mesh.
- [ ] Random synchonized sparkle animations.
- [ ] Animation speed linked to mesh nodes count. 

## Planned Features:
* Synchronized LED animations across mesh nodes.

Total Estimated Cost: ~$25

## Wemos D1 Mini Setup
1. Setup Arduino IDE for the ESP8266 (Wemos D1 Mini):  https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
2. Install Arduino library dependencies:
    * FastLED (EPS8266 DMA Fork): https://github.com/coryking/FastLED  -*this fixes flickering caused by interupts on the ESP8226 and the WS281x's* 

   * ESP8266TrueRandom: https://github.com/marvinroger/ESP8266TrueRandom
   
   * painlessMesh: https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh
        * And any painlessMesh dependencies: https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh#dependencies
3. Solder a Male JST Connector the WS281x to the Wemos D1 Mini:

| **WS281x**        |   **Wemos D1 Mini**| 
| :-------------: |:-------------: |
| Digital In (DI) | GPIO3 (Rx)
| Ground      | Ground       |
| 5v / Vcc | 5v       |

4. Connect your power source's 5v and Ground to the **WS2811x's dedicated 5v and Ground cables that are separate from the JST connectors.**  

5. Upload `syncrhobike.ino` to the Wemos D1 Mini 

**Note: It is suggested to unplug the LEDs from the Wemos D1 Mini while uploading the sketch. The LEDs being on the RX pin means that they can possibly interfeer with the upload, and will turn a very bright white.**
